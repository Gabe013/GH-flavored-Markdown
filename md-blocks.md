# This is a block (Headings are blocks)

A paragraph is a block.

To separate paragraphs, we need a line return between them.

**NB!** Tables are not offically supported blocks by Markdown or CommonMark?!

| Tables | Cells | And
| :-: | -: | :-
| Centered Tabel Data | Just. to the Right Data | Just. to the Left

Tables are blocks, too! By default, it writes text to the left.

Lists are blocks, ordered:

1. First Thing
1. Second Thing
1. 3rd Thing (using ones is the best to make sure it gets rendered as an ordered alphanumeric or character-like list)
1. And so on...
   * We can also nest lists like this, but it is not recommended ;)

1. Mama
1. Huhu
   1. Pizda
   1. Materina
   *  Can be used for documentation and TOContents :D 
     
* And unordered lists
  * And sub-lists like this (indent with two spaces to create a sub-list item and list)

Creepy verbatim no-comment/color-scheme code snippets:
  
    Verbatim code snippets, useless trash,
    hard to parse and search for.

*It's best* (accor. to Rob) to use Quotes for **long paragraphs** + written in *a single line*.

*Dunno what else... will check with Rob's video :D + ~~Code fences later ;)~~

Ah, yes, code fences! HTML webpage boilerplate time ;)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head><meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>HTML Boilerplate</title>
    </head>
    <body><h1>Bananna!</h1></body>
  </html>
```

~~~md
```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo hello world
```
~~~

Marking down Markdown in a color-coded named code fence*

(Maybe) Only use HTML comments in Markdown directly?! They will be *invisible* :)
<!--Mamma,uuuuuu.-->

And then, a horizontal line â˜º (3 dashes together MIN)
