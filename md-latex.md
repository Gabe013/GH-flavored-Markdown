This is some **LaTeX** - *piped matrices*:

$$
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
a & b & c
\end{vmatrix}$$

MD LaTeX Code:
```LaTeX
$$
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
a & b & c
\end{vmatrix}$$
```

And some *inline* LaTeX as well $\pi$ ðŸ˜Ž or $\(\sqrt{x^2+1}\)$ which can be referenced via plain code as `$\(\sqrt{x^2+1}\)$`.
