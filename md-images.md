[You can refer to an image as with a link](https://cdn.britannica.com/41/249341-050-E5F7039C/Actor-Elliot-Page-2022.jpg)

If you want **to load it directly**, it's best to *just drag it into the GH editor* or copy and paste:

![Like so, this is some Elliot dude/kid](https://github.com/desilvavelasquez123/markdown-book/assets/163108056/170f018d-faaf-436c-9eb5-1b73c58c1bcf)

Or, you can load it locally in your repo to *skip the assets folder* and stuff as so `![](filename.ext)`:

Or you can **hotlink** stuff (images) like this: `[![](filename.ext)](URL)`
